## Checklist for Financial Exam Setup

Here’s a quick checklist to ensure your calculator is set up correctly for your exam:

- [ ] **Date Format**: Ensure the date format is set to Month-Day-Year (M-D-Y).
- [ ] **Set the Payments per Year (P/Y)**: Set to 1 to avoid miscalculations.
- [ ] **Reset TVM (Time Value of Money)**: Clear any previous data in the TVM worksheet.
- [ ] **Enable Chain Calculations**: Confirm that the calculator is set to chain calculation mode.
